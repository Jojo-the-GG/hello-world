# hello-world
baby's first repository.
My name is Jo, I'm 18 years old and I consider myself more of a designer than a developper. The only programming I've done is some really basic html body text and making a point and click game in Action Script 2.0 (which is a dead program/language now). I struggle with writing code, so these classes are gonna be a challenge for me, to say the least.
